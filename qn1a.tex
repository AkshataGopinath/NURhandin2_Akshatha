In this section, the script and outputs for questions 1 are included. 
 

\subsection{Q 1a}
The code for the RNG using XOR shift and MWC: Code for 1a:

Figures for 1(a) are:

The RNG function random() seems to work well as evidenced by the figures below. The scatter plot has no visible correlation. The histogram has a mean of 50000, and bins that vary within 1 sigma of the mean. Since these are discrete samples, they will be poisson distributed and the $ sigma = \sqrt{mean}$, which is $\sqrt(50000) = 223.6$
