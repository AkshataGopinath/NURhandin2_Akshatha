The growth factor using Runge Kutta 4th oredr numerical solution of the 2nd order ODE is found for a period of 1000 years, with a step size of 1/100th of an year.
The manipulations done to the 2nd order ODE to be able to use RK4 are explained in the comments of the code itself. 
The analytical general solution of the second order differential equation can be written as:$$ D(t) = c1t^{2/3} + c2/t$$. Plugging in the appropriate coefficients(in the code), the solutions are over-plotted on the numerical solution obtained.

For the given initial conditions in an Einstein de-Sitter universe, we see that Case 1 and Case 3 show growth, while case 2 shows decay. This is to be expected since the initial condition for D'(t) for case 2 is negative. D'(t) determines how the expansion/collapse progresses with time.

The numerical solutions are also seen to match very well with the analytical solutions.
